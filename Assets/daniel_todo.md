## health / suit

**VITAL**
- oxygen when you hit zero, die
- game state

**NICE-TO-HAVE**
- screen-shake
- sfx
- leaky suit particles + sfx
- half-life warnings
- dynamic post-processing
- hit flash or animations

## asteroids

**VITAL**
- integration for dealing damage
- asteroid spawning targeting bugs out on tight ranges

**NICE-TO-HAVE**
- warning target for their impact location (small, grow bigger as approach)
- juice, like screen shake
- impact decal / crater (depth stuff?)
- better particle effects (the more dust-cloudy looking alpha ones)

## prefabs
- general asteroid
- space debris (drops items)
- flaming variant (catches AOE on fire)
