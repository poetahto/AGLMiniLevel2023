## asteroid spawner

**VITAL**
- make sure we can tweak the spawn rate, chances
  and other difficulty settings over time ect.

**NICE-TO-HAVE**
- instead of the random spawn points, random spawn splines / continuous thing?

## asteroids

**VITAL**
- integration for dealing damage

**NICE-TO-HAVE**
- warning target for their impact location (small, grow bigger as approach)
- juice, like screen shake
- impact decal / crater (depth stuff?)
- better particle effects (the more dust-cloudy looking alpha ones)

## prefabs
- general asteroid
- space debris (drops items)
- flaming variant (catches AOE on fire)
