# todo

## health / suit
- oxygen when you hit zero, die
- suit integrity (correlates to higher oxygen drain)
- UI views for seeing what current integrity and health is at

## asteroids

**VITAL**
- integration for dealing damage

**NICE-TO-HAVE**
- warning target for their impact location (small, grow bigger as approach)
- juice, like screen shake
- impact decal / crater (depth stuff?)
- better particle effects (the more dust-cloudy looking alpha ones)

## prefabs
- general asteroid
- space debris (drops items)
- flaming variant (catches AOE on fire)
