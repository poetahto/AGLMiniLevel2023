# todo

## general
- housekeeping: clean up folders + loose files

## asteroid spawner

**VITAL**
- test with spawning different asteroids
- spawn chances for diff asteroids
- make sure we can tweak the spawn rate, chances
  and other difficulty settings over time ect.
- clean up all of the spline paths that are generated (or pool them?)
- in general, look into pooling
- offload some spawning info into the asteroid
  (speed, range, ect.)
- make sure it works with dead player

**NICE-TO-HAVE**
- make sure it works with orbiting spawns
- instead of the random spawn points, random spawn splines / continuous thing?

## asteroids

**VITAL**
- play audio when they crash
- integration for dealing damage
- integration for part spawning
- warning target for their impact location (small, grow bigger as approach)

**NICE-TO-HAVE**
- juice, like screen shake
- impact decal / crater (depth stuff?)
- better particle effects (the more dust-cloudy looking alpha ones)

## prefabs
- general asteroid
- space debris (drops items)
- flaming variant (catches AOE on fire)
